# Supply-Chain-Management

Welcome to the Supply Chain Regression Analysis Repository!

## **OVERVIEW**

A Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company entered into the instant noodles business two
years back. Their higher management has noticed that there is a mismatch in the demand and
supply. Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low and vice-versa which results in a loss in
inventory cost and ultimately loss to the company. Hence, the higher management wants to
optimize the supply quantity in each and every warehouse in the entire country.

This repository houses a detailed analysis and prediction framework for supply chain data. The code covers a range of machine learning regression algorithms, offering insights into their performance on the provided dataset. Key features include data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of popular algorithms such as Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, and KNN.

## **Key Highlights:**

Data Exploration: Gain insights into the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and potential issues.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and prepare the data for modeling.

Univariate and Bivariate Analysis: Visualize attribute distributions and relationships with the target variable.

Modeling: Apply various regression algorithms to predict 'product_wg_ton.'

Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.

Feature Importance: Visualize feature importance where applicable for a better understanding of variable impact.

## **Performance Metrics for Top Models:**

Random Forest:

MSE: 817833.20

RMSE: 904.34

MAE: 677.17

R-squared: 0.99397

Gradient Boosting:

MSE: 826601.67

RMSE: 909.18

MAE: 697.15

R-squared: 0.99390

Explore the code, experiment with different models, and leverage insights for regression tasks in supply chain management or related domains.
